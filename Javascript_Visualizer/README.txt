To run the visualizer simply open index.html with a browser by right clicking the file and selecting "Open with" and select your browser of choice.
Operating Guidelines: 
1.) Upon opening or refreshing the page, a set of blue unsorted bars should appear with their labels. This is the expected start behavior.

2.)Click one of the sort options. The sort animation starts and runs to completion. The buttons are disabled while the animation is running. Buttons are re-enabled when the sort animation is done.

NOTE:Depending on the sort, you'll see different intermediate and end colors. So for example Merge sort, Selection sort,and Quick sort complete as a set of green bars while Heap completes as pink.They also use different intermediate sorting colors as well. The numbers and bar heights should be sorted properly regardless.

3.) To start a new sort, click "Generate New Array" or refresh your page. If you dont, the next sort animation will still run but it won't run properly and you will get unclear results and behavior.


To view the logic for the visualizer it is contained in the folder "js" while the visual specifications are in "css". 
DO NOT move index.html, index.js, or styles.css because index.html looks for them based on their relative paths.
