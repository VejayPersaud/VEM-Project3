# Welcome to Project 3 Repository!

This repository is a learning tool dedicated to exploring **Sorting Algorithms**.

## Project Components

Our project is divided into two main parts:

1. **C++ Sorting Algorithm Runtime Simulator**
   - Located in the `src` folder.
   - You'll find a dedicated `README.txt` in this folder which provides detailed instructions on how to run the runtime simulator.

2. **JavaScript Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**
   - Located in the `Javascript_Visualizer` folder.
   - This folder also contains a `README.txt` with instructions on how to run the visualizer.

## Additional Notes

- The `resources` folder and `TemplateUseDoc.md` are part of the original template and are not directly used by our project files.

Feel free to explore the repositories and contribute!
