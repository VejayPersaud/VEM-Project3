#This is our Project 3 Repository! It is a learning tool for learning about Sorting Algorithms.
#The project is split into two resources, a C++ sorting algorithm runtime simulator and the other is a Javascript sorting algorithm visualizer.
#The C++ runtime simulator can be found in folder "src". Inside there will be another README.txt specifically for that file on how to run the runtime simulator.
#The Javascript visualizer can be found in the folder "Javascript_Visualizer". Inside there will be another README.txt specifically on how to run the visualizer.
