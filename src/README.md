# How to Use `main.cpp` for Debugging

To properly use `main.cpp`, follow these steps within your development environment. 
## Getting Started

1. **Open `main.cpp` in your IDE.** 
   - We recommend Visual Studio but any IDE with similar debugging features should work.

2. **Start debugging.**
   - Initiate the debugging process as you normally would in your IDE.

## During Debugging

- **Input Request:** A debugging window will appear asking for input.
- **Specify Input:** Type `"t"` to run the sorting algorithms on 15 lists of randomly generated numbers.
- **Output:** The program will output 15 groups of information. Each group includes:
  - Runtime of a standard sort.
  - Runtime of a multithreaded version of the sort.
